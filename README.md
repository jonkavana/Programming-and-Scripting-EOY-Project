Programming-and-Scripting-EOY-Project

This repository will be used for the end of year project relating to the Programming and Scripting Module of the course.

The aim of this project is to provide an analytical oversight of Fisher's Iris data set


# Analysis of Fishers Iris Data set

i retrieved the link for my data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset#IRIS.csv "Kaggle")


As part of this project we are seeking to understand and appreciate what is that researchers are drawn to this data set


The first instance of the fisher data set is spoken about in the material of the proeject overview, as detailed by [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris "UCI"), such that there are a number of characteristics highlighted by the reserach. According to this site, the data set itself is a multivariate data set. There are 150 observations within the data set as well as four variables. These are all assumoptions that we will base our analysis from. However, it is prudent to note that these assumptions have yet to be validated, so no conclusion will be drawn as of yet. 


|Caracteristics| Instances| Attributes|
|--------------|----------|-----------|
|Multvariate   |    150   |     4      |

Multivariate analysis in data sets refers to the number of variables that are under examination. IN this case, we have been informed of four attributes. 

The first publshed work for this data set was called "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" and was publihsed in 1936, retrieved from [Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x "Wiley Online Library"). 
Taking inspiration from research that was linked to the mandible, lower jaw, as well as data trend analysis on the cranial measurement, Fisher sought to apply this research to taxonomy. Taxonomy, according to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/taxonomy "Merriam-Webster") is the "general principles of scientific classification" as they apply to flowers.

From the outset, Fisher is approaching the analysis of the differences between Iris types from a mathematical perspective. There are only two noted sepcied under consideration, the Iris Setosa and Iris Versicolor.
