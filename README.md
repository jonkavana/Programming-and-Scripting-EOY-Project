The aim of this project is to provide an analytical oversight of Fisher's Iris data set


# Analysis of Fishers Iris Data set

According to the [Encycloppaedia Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ronald-Aylmer-Fisher "Encycloppaedia Brittanica") Sir Ronald Fisher was British statistician, most commonly know for his development of statistical procedures. Fisher graduated from Cambridge in 1912, being awarded a B.A. in astronomy, primarily focusing on the mathematical components of the discipline.


In 1936, he published, what would become one of his most cited works, entitled "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems", retrieved from [Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x "Wiley Online Library"). 


According to the website [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris "UCI") there are a number of characteristics highlighted by the reserach undertaken by Fisher.


|Caracteristics| Instances| Attributes|
|--------------|----------|-----------|
|Multvariate  |    150   |     4      |


According to UCI, the data set itself is a multivariate data set.
Multivariate analysis in data sets refers to the number of variables that are under examination. 

There are also four attributes highlighted by site. The four attributes are the measurements taken from the 150 instances recorded. These are listed as: 
 - Sepal Length
 - Sepal Width
 - Petal Length
 - Petal Width

Taking inspiration from research other areas of study, such as the anatomy and physiology, including reviews of the  developement of the mandible (lower jaw), as well as the cranial measurement, Fisher sought to apply this research to taxonomy [Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x "Wiley Online Library"). This work also harnassed the concept of "linear funcitons of the measurements by which the populations are best discriminate". 

To provide greater clarity on the work he underrtook, Taxonomy, according to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/taxonomy "Merriam-Webster") is the "general principles of scientific classification" as they apply to flowers. We can see that this is the highest point at which the two disciplines are merging, mathematical principles and classification of flowers. 

From the outset, Fisher is approaching the analysis of the differences between Iris types from a mathematical perspective. It is clear to see that Fisher s developing on some of the foundational worl as undertaken in Cambridge.
According to the 'Arithmetical Procedure' aspect of the paper, there were only two species taken from the first set of Iris, that is the Iris Setosa and the Iris Versicolor.
The third Iris, is not taken from the same colony, the scope of the research appears to be focused on the first 100 instances before widening the lens to include the versicolor.

As part of this project we are seeking to understand and appreciate what is that researchers are drawn to this data set
