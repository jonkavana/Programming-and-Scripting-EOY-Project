The aim of this project is to provide an analytical oversight of Fisher's Iris data set


# Analysis of Fishers Iris Data set

## Overview of the Paper

According to the [Encyclopaedia Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ronald-Aylmer-Fisher "Encyclopaedia Brittanica") Sir Ronald Fisher was a British statistician, most commonly known for his development of statistical procedures. Fisher graduated from Cambridge in 1912, being awarded a B.A. in astronomy, primarily focusing on the mathematical components of the discipline.


In 1936, he published, what would become one of his most cited works, entitled "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems", retrieved from [Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x "Wiley Online Library"). 


Before undertaking any primary analysis,there are some observations that can be taken from the material ahead of time. According to the website [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris "UCI") there are a number of aspects highlighted by the reserach undertaken by Fisher. Such as:


|Caracteristics| Instances| Attributes|
|--------------|----------|-----------|
|Multvariate  |    150   |     4      |


According to UCI, the data set itself is a multivariate data set. Multivariate analysis in data sets refers to the number of variables that are under examination. According to [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/multivariate-analysis "ScienceDirect") is the experimentation of multiple measurements on an experimental unit, for which the relationship between the units are important.

There are also four attributes highlighted by site. The four attributes are the measurements taken from the 150 instances recorded. These are listed as: 
 - Sepal Length
 - Sepal Width
 - Petal Length
 - Petal Width

Sepal, by way of distinction to a petal, is the outermost part of the Iris flower. Whereas in the structure of the Iris, the petal is to be found inside the flower, according [Biology Dictionary](https://biologydictionary.net/sepal/ "Biology Dictionary")

Taking inspiration from research other areas of study, such as the anatomy and physiology, including reviews of the  developement of the mandible (lower jaw), as well as the cranial measurement, Fisher sought to apply this research to taxonomy [Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x "Wiley Online Library"). This work also harnassed the concept of "linear funcitons of the measurements by which the populations are best discriminate". 

To provide greater clarity on the work he underrtook, Taxonomy, according to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/taxonomy "Merriam-Webster") is the "general principles of scientific classification" as they apply to flowers. We can see that this is the highest point at which the two disciplines are merging, mathematical principles and classification of flowers. 

From the outset, Fisher is approaching the analysis of the differences between Iris types from a mathematical perspective. It is clear to see that Fisher s developing on some of the foundational worl as undertaken in Cambridge.
According to the 'Arithmetical Procedure' aspect of the paper, there were only two species taken from the first set of Iris, that is the Iris Setosa and the Iris Versicolor.
The third Iris, is not taken from the same colony, the scope of the research appears to be focused on the first 100 instances before widening the lens to include the versicolor.


## Praise for the Literature

According to the National Gardening Association, the term species, only refers to the name of the specific plant within the genus. Genus is the collective term for similar plants, according to the [National Gardening Association](https://garden.org/courseweb/course1/week3/page3.htm "NGA")

To this point, the measurements that have been taken within for ths dataset are unambiguous and are distinctive to each species. From the outset there are two specific callouts of the Iris Setosa and the Iris versicolor. 


## Criticism of the literature

As mentioned previously in this analysis, Fisher has mentioned from the outset that there are two specific species that have been collected, as detailed under the 'Arithmetical Procedure'. Without any mention of the third species, we are now introduced to a variation in the genus, the Iris Viriginica. This can be qute a confusing element to stumble across as there is no mentino of it until we read the table. 

Furthermore, there is no mention of why there is a third species as part of this paper until we reach the conclusionary stages of the paper. 
It is at this point, in the 'Applications to the theory of Allopolyploidy' that we discover that the first two species were measured within the same natural colony, and the third was taken from somewhere else. 

Fisher does address this issue with an acknowledgement of 

## Conclusion


## How has the Iris Data Set been adapted to modern literature

distinguishable on te non linear branching component
linear discriminant model - needs to be reviewed.
cluster analysis
pivot to machine learning
