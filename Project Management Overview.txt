This will act as a log of the project from commencement to cessation. 
the intent with this project will be to review the problem set and to detail a work breakdown structure
within each breakdown, there is going to be smaller units of activity that need to be completed, and at this stage
they will be shown in the structure of Breakdown 'A' - > Activity - > Task - > Sub-Task.
This is the intnded approach of the project, but it will be reviesed on an going basis. 

The first Breakdown will be in relaition to the problem set that has been detailed on the GMIT Site.
