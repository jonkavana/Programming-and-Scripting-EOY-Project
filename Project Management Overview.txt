This will act as a log of the project from commencement to cessation. 
the intent with this project will be to review the problem set and to detail a work breakdown structure
within each breakdown, there is going to be smaller units of activity that need to be completed, and at this stage

They will be shown in the structure of:
    Section 'A'
        Activity '1'
            Task '1.1'
                Sub-Task '1.1.1'

This is the intended approach of the project, but it will be reviesed on an iterative basis as the project develops. 

The first Breakdown will be in relaition to the problem set that has been detailed on the GMIT Site. For a copy of this brief, there is a pdf copy available in this repository for reiiew.
This document is intended as a complimentary document to the expected outcomes of the project. 

On reading the information that is contained in the project there are a number of areas that need to be reivewied. 

Project Breakdown:
    Section A) Fishers Data Set
        1) Find a data set that contains the original clean copy of the data set.
            1.1) Data set has been found
            1.2) Test to read in csv file
            1.3) Analysis
                1.3.1)
        2) Perform a research of the data set and why it is under analysis
        3) Code, using the data set a numnber of pieces of scrit to extract value and meaning from the data set

    Section B) Expected Output:
        4) Research from the information about Fishers data set are to be commited to the READ.md file
        5) Download the date
            5.1) Add it to the repository
            5.2) Reference to Activity 1
        6) Write an analysis called analysis.py, which contains:
            6.1) Output of each variable to a single text file
            6.2) Saves a histogram of each variable of png file type
            6.3) Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
            6.4) Prepare all of the above as if were to be presented, but contained in the git hub repository, specifically in relationt to the code. 

    Section C) Minimum Acceptance standards breakdown per file to be submitted:
        7) README
            7.1) Summary of the dataset as well as the investigations into it.
            7.2) Runbook of how to run the code from start to finish. 
            7.3) Fill list of references for all sources for all aspects of the project.
        8) Python Script
        9) Summary Text File

    Section D) Skills / Knowledge Gap:
        10) Overview of git and how to structure a project file / folder
        11) Review of the standards and principles that are considered best practise for a markdown file
            11.1) Review of the pseudo styling as spoken about it in the video.
            11.2) Open up the read.md file in a text editor and test to see how changes in the indentation will look once the y have been pused to github repository.
        12) Need to review how to display pdf in VS Code or remove file.
